Mod Objective:

This mod aims to rebalance the conviction drift for Roman Republic factions.

Addressing the Imbalance:

In the vanilla game, I noticed that some factions have their conviction swayed by two attributes, while others are influenced by only one. This creates an uneven playing field, particularly when playing as a Greek polis. For example, the Traditionalist party tends to dominate due to a lack of Oligarch characters to fill positions and shift the Senate balance.

The Rebalancing Solution:

This mod assigns two attributes to each faction, with varying influence on conviction drift.

Primary Attribute: This attribute has a stronger influence (0.02 multiplier) on the associated party's conviction.
Secondary Attribute: This attribute has a weaker influence (0.01 multiplier) on the associated party's conviction.

Modified Party Conviction Drift:

Attribute	            Finesse	Charisma	Martial	Zeal
Oligarchic Party	    0.01	-	        0.02	-
Optimates Party	        0.01	-	        0.02	-
Democratic Party	    0.01	0.02	    -	    -
Populares Party	        0.01	0.02	    -	    -
Traditionalist Party	-	    0.01	    -	    0.02
Boni Party	            -	    0.01	    -	    0.02

Additional Balancing:

To further balance the system, the mod introduces a governor_martial_mod with a 0.015 local_output_modifier.
